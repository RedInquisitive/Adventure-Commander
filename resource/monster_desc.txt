RLG327 MONSTER DESCRIPTION 1.1

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Skeleton
DESC
A spooky skeleton. It seems to be in this dungeon trying to protect
something. Don't turn your back on it - or do, you'll probably hear it 
coming considering how loud it is...

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME White Wolf
DESC
I'd say it's probably best to not wake the white wolf, but it looks like you
already have. It's fangs look sharp and it's growling at you. It bites hard,
if it manages to land a hit.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Ghost
DESC
AHH! IT'S A GHOST! CALL THE GHOSTBUSTERS, QUICK.

Looks like this ghost has no reason to stop for walls. Curiously, it seems
to always know where you are. If it could interact with the real world
better than causing annoying gusts of wind, perhaps it could do a little
more to harm you.

Hey, how'd it get that item through the wall anyway!

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Aatrox
DESC
Aatrox is an angry, no good demon that wants to see the destruction of the
world. Him, with his bloody sword of doom, could stomp you in a second. 
It's up to you to kick him out of the dungeon for good. But something seems
different about him. You seem to recall something about him "changing" in
a mythical book called "patch notes", but don't remember what.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Boar-q-pine
DESC
A vicious boar with deadly quills. Why does this one have quills? They seem
to get stuck everywhere anyway! It's so vicious and angry it breaks down the
walls of the dungeon. If you manage to leave it alone for long enough it
might collapse the ceiling!

It's unfortunate that these beasts go from being a docile and friendly
creature to an angry, vicious beast when older. This one is older, and
doesn't look happy.

Off the top of your head, you seem to recall reading about one in a book of
four nations...

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Golden Rajang
DESC
IT SHOOTS ELECTRICITY? WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? WHY IS IT SO FAST?

Maybe if I time my dodges correctly, I could roll right through it's laser
and not get my sorry ass carted back to the camp this time.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Alduin
DESC
Seems to share the same interests as Aatrox as a world eater.
Perhaps this time more... literally...

Vicious teeth, fierce eyes, Alduin has been waiting to take you on since the
beginning of time. You pull out your trusty sword in preparation to strike.
...And don't forget the cheese wheels. You'll need those too.

"And the Scrolls have foretold of black wings in the cold, 
That when brothers wage war come unfurled! Alduin, Bane 
of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, With a hunger to 
swallow the world!" 
    ―Song of the Dragonborn

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Octocat
DESC
It looks like an octopus, but it also looks like a cat. An octocat?
Some say they love to lie in the BRANCHES of CHERRY-PICKED trees, and others
say they can COMMIT to a full day on the beach under the sun. 

Other folks tell stories of octocats with DETACHED HEADs as spooky Halloween
stories. 

Unfortunately the octocat seems to become more in danger every day with 
people FORCE PUSHING the animal out of it's natural habitat. Maybe one day
they will GIT GOOD and find a way to survive.

It's a pretty standard goblin. Sort, angry, and packs a punch.

And the punch is coming right at you! Duck! 
Wait, that's a bad idea!

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Invader
DESC
It's an alien invasion! And they are shooting what appears to be little
squares! Quick, shoot them down with a cannon before they zig zag and
invade the world!

They seem to be in a pattern, so quick, take this 2600 controller and 
get blasting!

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Tiger
DESC
It's not a cat.
But you want to pet it.
But that would be a bad idea. 
You would like to keep your face in-tact today.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Xenomorph XX121
DESC
You know, now would be a REALLY GOOD TIME for an airlock to the vacuum of
outer space. Where are those when you need one anyway?

I guess the next best thing to take care of this would be fire, but it's
almost certain to come back. 

And it will be more angry than before.
Very...
Angry...

He also probably wouldn't like if you stuck a candle in his head.
