# Build
Install ncurses on Fedora: `sudo yum install ncurses-devel`
Install ncurses on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev` <- IMPORTANT
1. Run `make` to compile everything
2. Run `./game --help` so you know what's up
3. Run `./game` with wanted options

# Notable features for this version
- There is fog of war (f)
- Teleport anywhere with (g)
- Everything (I mean it!) is in C++

# Changes from specifications
- I made the visible area slightly bigger.
- Mobs use emoji if not disabled
- In order to support this, mobs are 2 characters wide
- Intelligent monsters follow the player with path finding for up to 5 turns
- Immutable dungeon walls are LOWER HALF BLOCK, UPPER HALF BLOCK and FULL BLOCK
- Halls are BOX DRAWING DOUBLE * (I used most of the double lined characters)
- Rock is LIGHT SHADE, MEDIUM SHADE, and DARK SHADE to represent hardness
- Rooms are SPACE

# Important console setup
This game uses UTF-8 to make it look nice! Please read this if your terminal 
looks messed up (ex: question marks or blank output):
- If you are using `gnome-terminal` (called Terminal), UTF-8 works with emoji. 
- If you are using `xterm`, press CTRL + RIGHT CLICK and enable TrueType fonts.
WARNING: All monsters will be boxes if you do this without --lame (sad)!
(Tested on CS327FedoraLinux)

# Other information
In any case, your locale should be set to "en_US.UTF-8". You can check with the
command `locale`. SSH environments can sometimes break this, so you might need
to put these in your `~/.profile` if you are using SSH and see question marks:
- `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
- `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
