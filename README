# Build
Run `make` then `./game`

# Requirements
Your terminal must support utf8. PuTTY supports this just fine, as well as
Cmder. Many modern linux terminals also support utf8. Characters will look
broken if your terminal is in ASCII mode!

# Notable features
- Random dungeons.
- Dungeon halls connect with some amount of randomness.
- Dungeon halls connect in a circular form, allowing movement to all other rooms.

# Changes from specifications
- Immutable dungeon walls are LOWER HALF BLOCK, UPPER HALF BLOCK and FULL BLOCK
- Halls are BOX DRAWING DOUBLE * (I used most of the double lined characters)
- Rooms are SPACE
- Rock is LIGHT SHADE
