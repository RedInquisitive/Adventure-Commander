## Build
Install ncurses on Fedora: `sudo yum install ncurses-devel`
Install ncurses on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev` <- IMPORTANT
1. Run `make` to compile everything
2. Run `./game`
3. Press `TAB` for in game help!

## Notable features for this version
- Real :tm: Combat!
- Monsters push other monsters out of the way
- You can beat the game by defeating the boss
- You have an inventory and equipment stash
- In game help screen (try TAB)
- You have a max weight as well as inventory space
- Some items are kind of OP...
- Some other things probably...
- Bugs maybe? It's 4:30 AM idk...

## Changes from specifications
- End target mode with ENTER instead of g/t
- Items are simply listed from 0 - 9, and aren't necessarily "slots"
- Items in your equipment are similarly labeled a - l and expand as needed.
- I made the fog visible area slightly bigger.
- Mobs use emoji if not disabled
- Uses emoji for all items
- Has own monster definition with emoji support
- In order to support this, mobs are 2 characters wide
- Intelligent monsters follow the player with path finding for up to 5 turns
- Immutable dungeon walls are LOWER HALF BLOCK, UPPER HALF BLOCK and FULL BLOCK
- Halls are BOX DRAWING DOUBLE * (I used most of the double lined characters)
- Rock is LIGHT SHADE, MEDIUM SHADE, and DARK SHADE to represent hardness
- Rooms are SPACE

## If you are having problems, see below

### Important console setup
This game uses UTF-8 to make it look nice! Please read this if your terminal 
looks messed up (ex: question marks or blank output):
- If you are using `gnome-terminal` (called Terminal), UTF-8 works with emoji. 
- If you are using `xterm`, press CTRL + RIGHT CLICK and enable TrueType fonts.
WARNING: All monsters will be boxes if you do this without --lame (sad)!
(Tested on CS327FedoraLinux)

### Other information
In any case, your locale should be set to "en_US.UTF-8". You can check with the
command `locale`. SSH environments can sometimes break this, so you might need
to put these in your `~/.profile` if you are using SSH and see question marks:
- `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
- `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
