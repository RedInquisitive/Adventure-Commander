# Build
Install ncurses on Fedora: `sudo yum install ncurses-devel`
Install ncurses on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev` <- Wide character support
Then run `make` then `./game`

# Notable features for this version
- Uses ncurses
- Emoji for monsters

# Changes from specifications
- Intelligent monsters follow the player with path finding for up to 5 turns
- Immutable dungeon walls are LOWER HALF BLOCK, UPPER HALF BLOCK and FULL BLOCK
- Halls are BOX DRAWING DOUBLE * (I used most of the double lined characters)
- Rock is LIGHT SHADE, MEDIUM SHADE, and DARK SHADE to represent hardness
- Rooms are SPACE

# Important console setup!!
This game uses UTF-8 to make it look nice! Please read this if your terminal 
looks messed up (ex: question marks or blank output):
- If you are using `gnome-terminal` (called Terminal), UTF-8 works. 
- If you are using `xterm`, press CTRL + RIGHT CLICK and enable TrueType fonts.
  WARNING: All monsters will be boring boxes if you do this!
(Tested on CS327FedoraLinux)

# Other information
In any case, your locale should be set to "en_US.UTF-8". You can check with the
command `locale`. SSH environments can sometimes break this, so you might need
to put these in your `~/.profile` if you are using SSH and see question marks:
- `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
- `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
